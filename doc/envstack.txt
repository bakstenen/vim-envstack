*envstack.txt* Set an environment using env files

Functions:
*SetEnv({env_files})*

Set the environment based on a list of .env files. Environment variables in
later env files will overwrite environment variables in earlier files.

For list type variables, the new values are prepended to the existing value
with the os specific path separator.

Standard list environment variables are
    - PATH
    - PYTHONPATH
    - PATHEXT
    - PSMODULEPATH

Define additional list environment variables with *g:list_env*
